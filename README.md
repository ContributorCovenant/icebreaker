# Goal
Force Palantir to make all of their OSS repos on GitHub private, to eliminate complicity opportunities, recruitment opportunities, and general participation opportunities for the company

## Objective 1
Demonstrate how much they rely on open source

## Objective 2
Inform OSS maintainers who may not be aware of how their work is being used

## Objective 3
Challenge OSS maintainers to re-license with an ethical license so that Palantir has to remove their dependencies

# Notes

* E.g. https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/network/dependencies

* Recommend that maintainers switch to an ethical source license like the HL or https://licensezero.com
* icebreaker.dev
* Heroku
* Background job: use the GH API to scrape dependencies for all Palantir projects; chase down the repo for the package; update the list
* Home page: Is your OSS being used by human rights abusers?
* Graph of total # of OSS dependencies over time
* Rack attack
  * Rotate error messages randomly on DDoS prevention
  * Permanent redirect error provides high-profile url to user agent (fbi.gov?)
