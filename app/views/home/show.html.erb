    ICE Uses Open Source to Violate Human Rights.
  </h2>

  <p>
    On any given day, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ADP_Detained_Immigrants_1994-2018.png">40,000 people are detained</a> by ICE
    in <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/ice-adelanto-detention-facility-inspector-report/">unsafe and unsanitary conditions</a>
    with <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/code-red-fatal-consequences-dangerously-substandard-medical-care-immigration-detention">sub-standard
    medical care</a> and <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/access-counsel-immigration-court">sporadic, if any, access to legal counsel.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    These conditions have led directly to <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/detaineedeaths-2003-2017.pdf">nearly two hundred
    detainee deaths at the hands of ICE</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    And if the human costs are not enough to persuade you, consider the financial ones. In 2018,
    <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/math-immigration-detention-2018-update-costs-continue-mulitply/">tax payers spent $3.076 billion
      dollars on DHS Custody Operations</a>. A budget four times greater than the Department of Education's
    English Language Acquisition programs.
  </p>

  <p>In addition to the cruelty of ICE and the financial costs to tax-payers, ICE is the public face
    <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/emergence-global-infrastructure-mass-registration-and-surveillance-report">
      of the United States&rsquo; ever-expanding domestic surveillance apparatus.</a> How? Through lucrative contracts with
      privately held technology companies like <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/ice-palantir-contract-amount-revealed/">Palantir</a>,
    <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17488328/microsoft-ice-employees-signatures-protest">Microsoft</a>, and even darling
    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/09/employees-ask-github-cancel-ice-contract-we-cannot-offset-human-lives-with-money/">GitHub</a>.

  <h2>Are we complicit?</h2>
  <p>
    At present, <a href="https://github.com/palantir">Palantir has <%= @repo_count %> repositories hosted on GitHub</a>, which rely on
    thousands of open source projects. Every dependency in use by ICE and Palantir contributes to human rights violations.
    Each dependency is a stone in the wall between reality and the dream of open source as a champion of freedom, liberty and equality.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="3-what-to-do">
  <h2>What can we do?</h2>
  <p>
    Students across the country are organizing to stop Palantir from recruiting on their campuses.
    Whistleblowers are risking everything to go public detailing how their companies are complicit.
    International human rights groups are investigating ICE. And immigrant rights activists are
    working tirelessly to protect vulnerable people from the evils of the current anti-immigrant
    policies put in place by the Trump administration (and other administrations before his.)
  </p>

  <p>
    It's time for software developers to step up, too.
  </p>

  <p>So what can you as a developer do?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You have a tech industry salary. You can probably afford to <a href="http://joinfundclub.com">donate $100 a month to #NoTechForICE causes</a>.</li>
    <li>Support and participate in <a href="https://mijente.net">#NoTechForICE protests and programs</a>.</li>
    <li>Keep your code from being used by ICE by <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev">adopting an Ethical Source license</a>.</li>
    <li>If all else fails, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20876495/github-seth-vargo-pulled-code-chef-ice-deportations-trump-administration">pull your public code</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Tear Down The Wall!
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is the wall that open source has built for ICE. Every open source dependency listed here (updated nightly) is used
    in Palantir's software and supports ICE in its systematic human rights violations.
